function obj = deleteTypes(obj,deletedType)
% Syntax:
%
% obj = deleteTypes(obj,deletedType)
%
% Description:
% 
% Delete types from the current nb_cs object (letter size 
% has somthing to say)
%
% If some of the types you specify in deletedType does not  
% exist in the obj, this will not have anything to say for the obj. 
% (The types cannot be deleted, because the types do not 
% exist.)
% 
% Input:
% 
% - obj         : An object of class nb_cs
% 
% - deletedType : Must be a char or a cellstr
% 
%     Delete all the type names, given in the char array 
%     or cellstr array deletedType, of current the nb_cs object.
% 
%     NB! If deletedType is just one string and include a * as the 
%         last letter, this function will delete all the type 
%         names, from the object, that start with the letters which 
%         is in front of the * in the string. 
% 
%         i.e. obj = deleteTypes(obj,'DPQ*');
% 
%         Deletes all the types in the obj which has type names 
%         starting with 'DPQ'.
% 
%         If deletedType is just one string and include a * as the 
%         first letter, this function will delete all the type 
%         names, from the object, that include the letters which 
%         follows in the string.
% 
%         i.e. obj = deleteTypes(obj, '*shift');
% 
%         Deletes all the types in the obj which has type names 
%         which include 'shift'.
% 
% Output: 
%
% - obj : A nb_cs object with the types specified in 
%         deletedType deleted.
% 
% Examples:
%
% obj = nb_cs([2;2],'test',{'First','Second'},{'Var1'});
% obj = deleteTypes(obj, {'First','Second'});
% obj = deleteTypes(obj, char('First','Second'));
% obj = deleteTypes(obj, obj.types);
