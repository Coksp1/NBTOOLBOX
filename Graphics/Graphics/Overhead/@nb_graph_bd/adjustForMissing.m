function x1 = adjustForMissing(obj,x0)
% Syntax:
% 
% adjustForMissing(obj,x0)
% 
% Description:
% 
% Adjust the x-value of a vertical graph element for graph objects of type
% nb_graph_bd. This is necessary as x0 represent how many periods after the
% startGraph property the vertical element should be drawn, but since we
% may have missing values, this is not only date - startGraph + 1.
%
% Input:
% 
% - obj : An object of class nb_graph_bd.
% 
% - x0  : Integer. Periods after startGraph for which the element should be
%         drawn.
%
% Output:
%
% - x1 : The corrected number of periods after startGraph the vertical
%        element should be drawn.
