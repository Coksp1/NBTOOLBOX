% Description:
%
% Particle swarm optimization for binary genomes.
%
% This function will optimize fitness functions where the variables are
% row vectors of size 1xnvars consisting of only 0s and 1s.
%
% PSO.BINARY is provided as a wrapper for PSO.DO, to avoid any confusion. 
% This is because the binary optimization scheme is not designed to take 
% any constraints. PSO.BINARY does not allow the passing of constraints. It
% takes a given optimization problem with binary variables, and
% automatically sets the options structure so that 'PopulationType'
% is 'bitstring'.
%
% This has exactly the same effect as setting the appropriate options
% manually, except that it is not possible to unintentionally define
% constraints, which would be ignored by the binary variable optimizer
% anyway.
%
% Problems with hybrid variables (double-precision and bit-string
% combined) cannot be solved yet.
%
% The output variables for PSO.BINARY is the same as for PSO.DO.
